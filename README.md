After doing many trials I was able to do the mock api . I tried to use nose tools but I wasnt successful and then later I did it without nose tools. 
In circle ci ,an error is coming continuously which is "Unsupported or missing workflows config version" and so I wasnt able to build. Even after trying for 2 days I cannot solve it
